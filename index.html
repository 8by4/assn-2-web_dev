          This blog is where I like to post my experiences
          traveling to other countries! 
          <br>
          <br>
          So far I have only been to Nagoya, Japan, but I plan 
          to update this blog with whatever trips I go on in the future!

          About Me: My name is Travis Traveler and I love to explore! I was born in New Jersey and raised by my family 
          who traveled around the world for the military constantly. This has been such an integral part of my life
          that I have decided to continue the habit into my adult years! With my family I have been to Greece, Mexico, Ireland,
          Spain, and Canada. However I am deciding to not include those here and only include my solo adventures!
