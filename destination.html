            Overall, Nagoya has been my favorite place I have ever traveled ever. The city itself is absolutely
            gorgeous with amazing attractions. Outside of this, the suburban areas nearby are just as entertaining
            and can often even be more enjoyable. With areas such as the Ghibli park or NUFS nearby, it's easy to see
            why I loved this location so much!
